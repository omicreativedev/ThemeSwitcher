## Important Notes:
* If handling an Issue or Bug or Enhancement, PLEASE WAIT FOR APPROVAL to get started.
* **ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOUR BRANCH IS UP TO DATE AND CONFLICTS RESOLVED (IF POSSIBLE) BEFORE YOU PR**
  
## PR 1 - Create A New DEMO Page
* Copy and existing page and name it anything, ex: demo.html and should be in the same folder as omicreativedev.html
* Edit the contents ofdemo.html
* Don't remove the javascript, the themeswitch drowpdown, or the link back to home!
* YES, you can change or remove styling classes BUT your page SHOULD use the themeswitcher and look good with all themes.
* YES, you can add custom CSS to the header of demo.html IN ADDITION to using the themes.
* TEST ALL YOUR CODE LOCALLY and make SURE it is SAFE and that nothing breaks BEFORE requesting to merge.
* YES, if you know how, you can add custom Javascript. It MUST be safe!
* DO NOT ALTER any theme files when making a page or other pages in the site.
* If your page needs images, you can add them in pages/img/filename/
* If your make an external JS file for just your page, put it in pages/js/filename/
* If you have an image or js file that ANYONE can use, put it in pages/img/ or pages/js/ respectively.
* If you have to make a change to another page or theme, please comment your change with your username and profile link
* When you create a page, you must update pages_list.txt
* Your PR should be demo.html, pages_list.txt, and contributors.md ONLY
  #### SOME PAGE IDEAS - MAKE PAGES NICE not EASY. Challenge yourself! Be creative!

    * A Pure CSS Graphic
    * An AI Generated Meme
## PR 2 - Create A New Theme in Themes Folder
* Start by copying an existing theme and renaming it to whatever you like (keep it PG rated!)
* Edit the theme so that it is 100% unique.
* Add your name in a comment and link to your github and/or twitter to the top of the theme
* Changes to other themes/pages should NOT break or significantly disturb other people's themes, pages, layouts.
* TEST ALL YOUR CODE LOCALLY and make SURE it is SAFE and that nothing breaks BEFORE requesting to merge.
* WE ARE NOT converting to LESS or SCSS for the purpose of this being beginner friendly.
* When you create a theme, you must update themes_list.txt
* Your PR should be yourtheme.css, themes_list.txt, and contributors.md ONLY
  #### SOME THEME IDEAS

    * A Winter Theme with Snow
    * A Hyperwave Theme
    * A Minimalist Theme
## OTHER PR IDEAS
* Fix an Issue
* Suggest an Enhancement
## WHAT NOT TO DO
* Do not forget to keep your branch updated and resolve any problems before making a pull request.
* Do not stray too far from the path! I don't have the capacity to deal with a lot of branch conflicts. Please stay within the the scope of creating pages and themes. Themes should work on all pages. Nothing should break. Everything should be in neat folders where it belongs so nothing becomes too messy.
* Do not spam. This includes making PRs for small typos, fixing white space, etc. [Here are some examples of bad practices](https://twitter.com/shitoberfest). If it is a small change, just bring it up in a discussion or raise an issue.
