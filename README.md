This project is a free website template (CC0-OpenSource) with theme switcher and page switcher written in Javascript. You can drop the theme switcher and/or page switcher into your project. Or you can download the website as a free template and use it to get started.

### Features
- Flat file list of themes located in a theme folder so you can make multiple css files for your site!
- Flat file list of pages located in a pages folder so you can make webpages, presentation slides, activities, etc.
