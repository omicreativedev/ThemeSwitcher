# Code of Conduct

1) Spam PRs will be labeled as spam. Spam is defined as:
    * Fixing small typos, grammatical errors, and in front end readable text.
    * Code fixes without being assigned an issue (simply create the issue and offer to fix it first.)
    * Contributions that don't fit into the scope of the project ie. adding python
Note: You can open a DISCUSSION about the problem or idea and we can chat about it!
2) Please update an issue you are assigned within 3 days. You can post a comment in the issue or start a discussion. Inactivity may result in you being unassigned if someone else is interested in working on an issue.
3) Read CONTRIBUTING.md
4) Read https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters/
5) This code of conduct may change based on problems that may arise.
